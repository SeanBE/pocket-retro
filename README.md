# Pocket Retro

Pocket updated their design recently. I love it but it has affected my main usecase for Pocket.

This simple application fetches article links and archives them when you open the original article in a new tab.
Powered by a Python service using Bottle and a Typescript React frontend. PRs and issues are welcome!
